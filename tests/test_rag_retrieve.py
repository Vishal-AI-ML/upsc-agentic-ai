"""Regression test for the production RAG retrieve bug.

Background:
    ``retrieve_node`` used to hardcode a local Chroma directory
    (``persist_dir_for`` + ``os.path.exists`` + ``Chroma(persist_directory=...)``)
    instead of the backend-agnostic ``load_vector_store()``. On a Qdrant-backed
    deployment the on-disk dir never exists, so retrieval always returned empty
    context and the mentor answered WITHOUT grounding.

This test fails if that pattern ever comes back.
