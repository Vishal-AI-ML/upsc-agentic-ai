First attempt. Foundation is everything right now.
- NCERTs before any standard book — no exceptions
- Don't skip basics to seem advanced
- Syllabus coverage > answer writing at this stage
- Too many resources is the #1 killer — ONE book per subject, read it completely
- This attempt: build the base. Real competition starts attempt 2.
""",
    "2": """
Second attempt. You know the terrain — now go deeper, not wider.
- Same books, better retention. No new resources unless critical gap.
- Do a hard gap analysis: where exactly did Prelims marks bleed out?
- Answer writing must start month 1 — not month 4
- Revision cycles must be tighter — 3 full revisions minimum before Prelims
- Biggest trap: thinking new books = new results. They don't.
""",
    "3": """
Third attempt. This is serious territory — no room for the same mistakes.
- Mandatory: sit down and write exactly what went wrong in attempts 1 and 2
- If Prelims is the problem — mock test analysis is non-negotiable, daily
- If Mains is the problem — answer writing quality must jump dramatically
- Get answers evaluated externally — not just self-assessment
- Brutal truth: doing the same thing a third time will give the same result

4th attempt or beyond. Complete strategy reset required.
- What you've been doing clearly isn't working — identify it and stop
- Get a mentor or structured coaching — self-study alone has limits
- Diagnose precisely: Prelims failure or Mains failure? Attack that specifically
- This attempt must be fundamentally different from the previous ones

Decide in the next 2 weeks. Not deciding is a decision to fail.
How to choose:
- Background: Your graduation subject or something you genuinely studied
- Overlap with GS: Geography (GS1), Public Admin (GS2), Sociology (GS1/2), History (GS1)
- Scoring trends: Anthropology, Geography, Pub Ad, Sociology score consistently high
- Interest: You'll spend 400+ hours on this. Pick something you won't dread.

Top 3 recommendations:
1. Geography — Scientific, map-based, heavy GS1 overlap. Abundant material.
2. Anthropology — Small syllabus, high scoring, diagrams boost marks.
3. Public Administration — Structured, GS2 overlap, good for analytical thinkers.
