"""Top-level supervisor graph (hierarchical router).

The supervisor classifies a free-text message into one specialist and dispatches
to the matching subgraph. All subgraphs share ``AgentState``, so they are nested
directly as nodes. Only the supervisor is compiled with a checkpointer/store;
nested subgraphs inherit memory through the shared state.

Routing:
    mentor           General doubts, concept explanations, advice, motivation, chat.
    planner          Create / revise a study plan or timetable.
    evaluator        Check, grade, or evaluate a written answer.
    current_affairs  Daily / monthly current affairs, news, editorials.
    rag              Questions about a specific document (NCERT / lecture / upload / PYQ).

Form-style specialists (planner / evaluator / current_affairs) read their
structured parameters from ``state['task_inputs']``; rag additionally needs
``state['persist_key']``. A caller may also force a route by pre-setting
``state['route']`` (e.g. when the UI already knows the target).
