"""Shared state object for the UPSC agentic system.

This ``TypedDict`` is the single state contract passed between every subgraph
(mentor, NCERT, lecture, current affairs, ...) and the top-level supervisor.
``total=False`` marks all keys optional, so each node only populates the
fields it is responsible for and leaves the rest untouched.
